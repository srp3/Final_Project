Project: Covid Escape

Group's repository: https://github.com/shermy99/Final_Project

What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project? I learned about the idea of putting 
regenerative things on the map like ammo and health! was really cool!

In what ways does this game reflect the theme? The virus attacks you and you have to shoot it with the gun, really cool idea!

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to 
apply to your own future games? I like their concept in general its like zombies, you can expand 
upon it super easily and the gamer keeps on playing and having fun! i played like a good 7 to 8 rounds it was fun!!!

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game? I would make the hitbox for the virus better 
as i had to shoot in a certain area for the bullet to connect.

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what? Nothing was confusing.

Is it clear that every group member participated? yes

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE? yes

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more 
descriptive? It honestly contains the right amount of info, unless you made the game more complex, no need to add more to readme.

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game. I'm not entirely sure as to how the group worked together on this, but
they sure did an amazing job. I enjoyed the game and played it for about 4 rounds before i finally won lol. And then i played another 3 
rounds for fun, Id keep going if it expanded like zombies that would be so dope!
How many of your points would you allocate to this project? 3
